The above is a half-finished skeleton code.
The issue with the a script that will create new
rules is beyond my skill, as well as not worth it.
The amount of input needed to determine the create command
takes more time than refering to the documentation. So,
I made a script that prints out useful documentation instead.

I will keep the above code just for reference or improvement in the future
